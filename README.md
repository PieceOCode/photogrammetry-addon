# photogrammetry-addon
A simple Addon for Blender, which simplefies common steps when creating game-ready photogrammetry models
, e.g. orienting the model, cutting off unwanted environment, creating a low poly and baking textures.

The addon can be installed by downloading the file in the repository and installing it in Blender by going to "Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install".
Afterwards the addon panel can be found under Photogrammetry in the editor sidebar, which can be extended by pressing the N key.
Because blender does not seem to support multifile addons, all the content is currently pasted in one file.
